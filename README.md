**KubeCuro** is a high-performance, production-grade CLI tool designed to eliminate the "silent killers" of Kubernetes deployments.

> [!TIP]
> **Get started in seconds:**
> ```bash
> # 1. Install (Linux x86_64)
> curl -L -O https://github.com/nisharas/kubecuro/releases/download/v1.0.0/kubecuro && chmod +x kubecuro && sudo mv kubecuro /usr/local/bin/
> 
> # 2. Scan your manifests (Ensure the folder contains .yaml or .yml files)
> kubecuro scan .
> ```
---

### 🎯 Our Mission
**To ensure that every Kubernetes manifest is not just syntactically correct, but logically sound and production-ready.** We believe that YAML validation should go beyond "Is it valid?" and answer "Will it work?"

### 📄 Project Metadata
**Author:** Nishar A Sunkesala / FixMyK8s  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Stable / Production Ready  

---

### 🔍 The Gap & The Solution

**The Gap:** Current CI/CD pipelines use "Validators" that only check if a YAML file is technically valid. They fail to detect if a Service will actually reach its Pod (due to label mismatches) or if an API version is deprecated.

**The Solution:** KubeCuro closes this feedback loop. It analyzes the **relationships** between files, detecting logical orphans and connection gaps before they reach your control plane.

---

### ⚖️ Why KubeCuro? (The Logic Gap)

Most tools only check if the "grammar" of your YAML is correct. KubeCuro checks if the "story" makes sense.

| Feature | Standard Linters | KubeCuro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YAML Syntax Check | ✅ | ✅ | 
| Schema Validation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto-Heal Formatting | ❌ | ✅ | 
| Cross-File Logic (Synapse) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Service-to-Pod Mapping | ❌ | ✅ | 
| Port Alignment Audit | ❌ | ✅ |

### 🚀 Why use KubeCuro?
1. Reduce "Developer Friction" - 
Instead of a CI/CD pipeline failing with a cryptic "Invalid YAML" error, KubeCuro tells the developer exactly what happened and, in many cases, fixes it for them. This reduces the back-and-forth between Dev and Ops.

2. Prevent Silent Failures -
A Service with a typo in its selector won't throw a Kubernetes error—it just won't send traffic to your Pods. These "silent failures" are the hardest to debug. Synapse catches these instantly.

3. Zero-Dependency Portability
Thanks to the static build process, KubeCuro is a single, 15MB binary.

    * No Python required.
    * No pip install.
    * Just chmod +x and run. This makes it perfect for Scratch-based Docker images or restricted CI runners.
      
4. Smart Tab-Completion: Full support for Bash and Zsh with an automated installer.

5. Explain Engine: Direct access to K8s logic best practices via `kubecuro explain`.
### 🛠️ The Three Pillars of KubeCuro
| Engine | Purpose | Real-World Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🩺 Healer | Auto-Fixing | Stops "Death by Indentation." Automatically repairs syntax and formatting issues, showing a clear diff of changes. |
| 🧠 Synapse | Logic Audit | Detects "Ghost Services." Ensures that Selectors, Labels, and Ports actually align across different files. |
| 🛡️ Shield | Security & Versioning | Prevents "API Rot." Flags deprecated API versions and insecure configurations before they hit your cluster. |

### 🚀 Intelligent Logic Checks (Verified)

KubeCuro goes beyond standard linters by auditing the **relationships** between your resources.

#### 🧠 Synapse: Networking & Scaling Logic
* **Ghost Service Detection:** Identifies `Services` that target labels matching zero `Pods`. (Verified in tests)
* **HPA Resource Gap:** Flags `HorizontalPodAutoscalers` that scale based on CPU/Memory when those resources aren't defined in the deployment. (Verified in tests)

#### 🛡️ Shield: Versioning & Security
* **API Rot Protection:** Automatically detects deprecated API versions (like `extensions/v1beta1`) before they break your cluster upgrade. (Verified in tests)
* **Severity Scoring:** Issues are categorized into `GHOST`, `PORT`, and `API` for easy prioritization.

#### 🩺 Healer: Structural Repair
* **Auto-Repair:** The `fix` command automatically heals YAML indentation and upgrades deprecated APIs while maintaining a dry-run preview. (Verified in tests)

### 📦 Supported Kubernetes Resources

KubeCuro currently provides deep-logic analysis for the following core resources:

| Resource Type | Synapse (Logic) | Shield (Security) | Healer (Auto-Fix) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Deployments** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Services** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **HPAs** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Ingress** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **StatefulSets** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

> **Note:** We are constantly adding new resource definitions. If you need support for a specific CRD, please open an issue!

### 🧠 Diagnostic Intelligence

KubeCuro categorizes issues based on their impact on cluster stability:

- 🔴 GHOST (Critical): Service exists, but its selector matches zero Pods. Traffic will be dropped.
- 🔴 PORT (Critical): Service targetPort does not match any containerPort in the targeted Pods.
- 🟠 NAMESPACE (Warning): Matches found, but resources are isolated in different namespaces.
- 🟡 API (Warning): Using deprecated API versions (e.g., extensions/v1beta1) that will fail on upgrade.
  
### 🛡️ Security & Privacy Audit

KubeCuro is designed with a "Security-First" architecture, operating as a localized static analysis tool.

* **Zero Data Leakage:** Runs entirely locally. No external network requests.
* **Air-Gapped by Design:** Does not need a connection to the K8s API server.
* **Read-Only by Default:** The scan command never modifies your files.

### ⚖️ Design Philosophy: The "Safe" CNCF Approach
KubeCuro is built on the principle of Predictable Automation. We distinguish between structural repair and logical intent to ensure your manifests remain under your total control.

🩺 The Healer (Active): Auto-fixes Syntax. It handles the "busy work" by repairing indentation, fixing tab/space conflicts, and ensuring YAML standards (via ruamel.yaml).

🧠 Synapse & Shield (Passive): Provides Intelligence. These engines detect logical gaps (like GHOST services) and security risks. Instead of making dangerous assumptions, they provide a Remediation Guide so a human engineer can make the final, informed decision.

Why? In production Kubernetes environments, auto-fixing a label could accidentally route traffic to the wrong database. KubeCuro fixes the format but respects your intent.
