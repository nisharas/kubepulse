**KubeCuro** is a high-performance, production-grade CLI tool designed to eliminate the "silent killers" of Kubernetes deployments. While standard linters merely validate YAML syntax, KubeCuro performs a deep-tissue scan to ensure your infrastructure is **Syntactically Healthy**, **Logically Connected**, and **API Future-Proof**.

**KubeCuro** isn't just another linter; it's a "Kubernetes Sanitizer." While most tools focus on schema validation, KubeCuro focuses on the functional integrity of your entire manifest suite. It bridges the gap between writing YAML and successfully running it.

## 📄 Project Metadata

* **Author:** Nishar A Sunkesala / [FixMyK8s](https://github.com/nisharas)
* **Version:** 1.0.0
* **Status:** Stable / Production Ready
* **Repository:** [https://github.com/nisharas/kubecuro](https://github.com/nisharas/kubecuro)

## 🎯 The Gap & The Solution

**The Gap:** Current CI/CD pipelines use "Validators" that only check if a YAML file is technically valid. They fail to detect if a Service will actually reach its Pod (due to label/namespace mismatches) or if an API version is deprecated.

**The Solution:** KubeCuro closes this feedback loop. It analyzes the **relationships** between files, detecting logical orphans and connection gaps *before* they reach your control plane.

## 🛠️ The Three Pillars of KubeCuro
| Engine | Purpose | Real-World Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🩺 Healer | Auto-Fixing | Stops "Death by Indentation." Automatically repairs syntax and formatting issues, showing a clear diff of changes. |
| 🧠 Synapse | Logic Audit | Detects "Ghost Services." Ensures that Selectors, Labels, and Ports actually align across different files. |
| 🛡️ Shield | Security & Versioning | Prevents "API Rot." Flags deprecated API versions and insecure configurations before they hit your cluster. |

---

## 🚀 Why use KubeCuro?
1. Reduce "Developer Friction"
Instead of a CI/CD pipeline failing with a cryptic "Invalid YAML" error, KubeCuro tells the developer exactly what happened and, in many cases, fixes it for them. This reduces the back-and-forth between Dev and Ops.

2. Prevent Silent Failures
A Service with a typo in its selector won't throw a Kubernetes error—it just won't send traffic to your Pods. These "silent failures" are the hardest to debug. Synapse catches these instantly.

3. Zero-Dependency Portability
Thanks to the static build process, KubeCuro is a single, 10MB binary.

    * No Python required.
    * No pip install.
    * Just chmod +x and run. This makes it perfect for Scratch-based Docker images or restricted CI runners.

## ⚖️ Why KubeCuro? (The Logic Gap)

Most tools only check if the "grammar" of your YAML is correct. KubeCuro checks if the "story" makes sense.

| Feature | Standard Linters | KubeCuro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YAML Syntax Check | ✅ | ✅ | 
| Schema Validation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auto-Heal Formatting | ❌ | ✅ | 
| Cross-File Logic (Synapse) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Service-to-Pod Mapping | ❌ | ✅ | 
| Port Alignment Audit | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Audit

KubeCuro is designed with a "Security-First" architecture, operating as a localized static analysis tool.

* **Zero Data Leakage:** Runs entirely on your local machine. No external network requests or data collection.
* **Air-Gapped by Design:** Does not communicate with the Kubernetes API Server. No `kubeconfig` or credentials required.
* **No Privilege Escalation:** Operates with the same permissions as the local user.
* **Safe Parsing:** Uses `ruamel.yaml` to prevent malicious code injection within YAML manifests.

## 🩺 Diagnostic Intelligence

KubeCuro categorizes issues based on their impact on cluster stability:

- GHOST (Critical): Service exists, but its selector matches zero Pods. Traffic will be dropped.
- PORT (Critical): Service targetPort does not match any containerPort in the targeted Pods.
- NAMESPACE (Warning): Matches found, but resources are isolated in different namespaces.
- API (Warning): Using deprecated API versions (e.g., extensions/v1beta1) that will fail on upgrade.

---
## ⚖️ Design Philosophy: The "Safe" CNCF Approach
KubeCuro is built on the principle of Predictable Automation. We distinguish between structural repair and logical intent to ensure your manifests remain under your total control.

🩺 The Healer (Active): Auto-fixes Syntax. It handles the "busy work" by repairing indentation, fixing tab/space conflicts, and ensuring YAML standards (via ruamel.yaml).

🧠 Synapse & Shield (Passive): Provides Intelligence. These engines detect logical gaps (like GHOST services) and security risks. Instead of making dangerous assumptions, they provide a Remediation Guide so a human engineer can make the final, informed decision.

Why? In production Kubernetes environments, auto-fixing a label could accidentally route traffic to the wrong database. KubeCuro fixes the format but respects your intent.

## 📊 Sample Report

When you run kubecuro, it generates a high-fidelity diagnostic report. Below is an example of a scan detecting a GHOST service (label mismatch) and a deprecated API.
```text
KubeCuro: Kubernetes Logic Diagnostics
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🩺 [DIAGNOSTIC REPORT] File: web-service.yaml
============================================================
-  selector:
-      app: web-server    <-- (Error: Mixed tabs/spaces)
+  selector:
+    app: web-server      <-- (Healed: Standard 2-space indent)
============================================================
SUCCESS: Configuration file 'web-service.yaml' has been healed.
